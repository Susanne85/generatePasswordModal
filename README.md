Generate Password Modal
This application generates a Random Password using a Modal structure
This module generates a random password based on selection criteria entered by a user.

The user is able to chose a number of character sets to include and a password length between 8 and 128. 
For each character set selection it is written to a string and the random password is generated on this string. 

This will produce a more random password.
